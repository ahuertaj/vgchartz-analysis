# vgchartz-analysis
Final Capstone Project - Python Analysis of data from vgchartz.com

This project fulfills the requirements for my final capstone at Thinkful. I took raw data scraped from vgchartz.com and cleaned, organized, formatted, analyzed, and charted my findings. I performed several t-tests and other statistical evaluations. I also presented my results to an audience.

This project is currently formatted as a Colab notebook in order to best demonstrate my work. Depending on interest, I may format it as a self-contained script that generates an external report, instead.
